          <h2>A news application with a comparative political twist!</h2>
            <h3>With the current chaos of everyday news its hard to keep up with whats happening and how to know if a source is truthful. News stories through social media can be helpful, but a lot of times its a spread of misinformation or biased towards a certain party. This app is for an audience who cares about the world, but wishes they could just see the facts, see every side to the topic, and then make up their own mind about it.</h3>
