          <h2>A news application with a comparative political twist!</h2>
            <h3>With the current chaos of everyday news its hard to keep up with whats happening and how to know if a source is truthful. News stories through social media can be helpful, but a lot of times its a spread of misinformation or biased towards a certain party. This app is for an audience who cares about the world, but wishes they could just see the facts, see every side to the topic, and then make up their own mind about it.</h3>

                <p>adJUST news is an app that give users the opportunity to have a go-to source for topics where they can compare facts to news stories. This way users can make up their own minds and choose what they want to believe regarding each topic. <br></br>By offering facts and categorized news stories by political party, users will be able to construct their own thoughts and determine their own beliefs. This saves the user time by not having to research through multiple news channels and gives them the structure to see where each news source stands politically.
                <br><br>The goal of this application is to cut down on confusion, shed light on the missing gaps between parties, and be an informative place that people can depend on. By being an all in one spot for current issues, the hope is that people will not only find their own voice, but find a way to come together as well.</p>

              <p> To create a target user and audience, I referenced articles such as Politifacts "A closer look at turnout, young voters..." as well as articles taking a in depth look at independent voters. The Conversation and the Gallop.com were great resources for the independent view. In addition to this research, I took the main target profile of a social media user and interlaced the information with a politcally independent, and/or leaning viewers perpective. </p>

              Through Allsides system, finding other articles like Thoughtco’s “Top 9 Conservative News and Opinion Websites” and Ad Fontes Media chart, I was able to get a general Idea of where the news would stand politically.</p>
